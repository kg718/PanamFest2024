# PanamFest2024

This Game is intended to be played using a set of Rexy Wheels set on Mouse mode.
The wheels are used for directional input and the left button is used to cast the fishing line.
It is also recomended to play using an X Box adaptive controller.
The A and B buttons both work as a "foot Pedal" to let you accelerate.
The foot pedal is not required but adds to the expierience of the game.
